## Yolo Mark Utility

This repository is code for a lightweight data capture utility that provides a graphical user interface for drawing bounding boxes around objects in images for the creation of training datasets for deep learning applications.  The basic program is based on the [Yolo_mark repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark).  The program outputs data files in yolo format text files.

The program was developed at Harper Adams University by Matt Butler.
